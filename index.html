            <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Bottlebrush</p>
            <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Melaleuca citrina (syn. Callistemon citrinus)</p>

            <h2>General Description</h2>
            <p>The Bottlebrush tree, native to Australia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree known for its vibrant, cylindrical flower spikes that resemble a bottle brush. These plants thrive in temperate to tropical climates, particularly along Australia's east coast. They typically grow to heights of 3 to 15 feet, with some varieties reaching up to 25 feet. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often release a lemony scent when crushed. The bright red, pink, yellow, or white flowers bloom primarily from spring to summer, attracting pollinators like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Bottlebrush plants are drought-tolerant, adaptable to various soil types, and commonly used in landscaping due to their striking appearance and low maintenance.</p>[](https://kidadl.com/facts/history-geography-social-studies/bottle-brush-tree-facts-uses-flowers-problems-and-more)[](https://www.healthbenefitstimes.com/bottlebrushes/)
